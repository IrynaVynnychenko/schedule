Needs to hire 2 Freelancers
I'm looking for someone who is talented in CSS / SCSS to build layouts from PSD / Figma.
Has at least middle English and very high attention to details and writing quality code.

I have a lot of different / interesting projects to work on and already have a few members in my team from Ukraine.

After some testing period (1-2 month) if you are the one I'm looking for I can give you as much work you can handle (even 8 hours a day, but I'm ok with 4 hours a day also if you don't have more time)

If you are interested please submit a small test on Github.
The layout that needs to be built is attached, it should be mobile fist / responsive.
Please create with SCSS and add an npm script for me that will build into CSS. (If you drop in some HTTP server so I can check easily it is a plus but not a must at all)

I'm interested without giving any further guidance on:
- the layout of the code you do
- solutions you use
- the structure and the naming of the files and folders
- the way hove you build the responsive part
- and some other things I'm not listing here :))

Please also tell me how much time you took for making this test.

As you can see it is a super simple test I cannot pay for this one, this is your entry task.

However, I'll analyze all submissions and I'll tell you what I liked and not liked about the solution.

Should you like to have a video call with me or have more questions, no problem, just drop me a message.
